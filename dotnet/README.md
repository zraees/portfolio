## Project 2.1: Onion Architecture Implementation

This project showcases the implementation of the Onion Architecture pattern, a popular design approach that promotes separation of concerns and enhances the maintainability of the codebase.

The key highlights of this project include:

- **Layered Architecture**: The application is divided into distinct layers, such as Domain, Infrastructure, Application, API, and UI, each with a specific responsibility.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Higher-level modules depend on abstractions provided by lower-level modules, fostering flexibility and testability.
- **Data Access with Entity Framework 6**: The project integrates Entity Framework 6 for seamless data access, leveraging the power of SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition.
- **ASP.NET MVC 5 UI**: The client-side user interface is built using ASP.NET MVC 5, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience.

By following the Onion Architecture pattern, this project demonstrates the benefits of improved testability, flexibility, and scalability, making it a valuable reference for developers looking to implement a well-structured and maintainable application.
