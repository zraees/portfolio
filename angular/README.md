# Project 3: Angular Projects (Versions 15 & 18)

## Project 3.1: Players Dashboard

An Angular 18 application that displays a players dashboard. It retrieves player details from a JSON data source and uses Angular Signals to efficiently manage and reflect changes in the data, without relying on Zone.js.

**Key Features:**
- Retrieves player details from a JSON data source
- Displays player information in a dashboard format
- Leverages Angular Signals to efficiently manage data updates and state changes
- Avoids the use of Zone.js, providing a more lightweight and performant solution

**Technologies Used:**
- Angular 18
- TypeScript
- RxJs
- HTML/CSS
- JSON data format

## Project 3.2: API Consumption

An Angular 18 application that consumes an API developed using .NET Core. It fetches data from the API and presents it in a responsive and interactive user interface, demonstrating the ability to integrate with external data sources.

**Key Features:**
- Integrates with a .NET Core-based API to retrieve data
- Displays the data in a user-friendly and responsive interface
- Leverages Angular 18 features and best practices for efficient API consumption
- Demonstrates the ability to work with and integrate external data sources

**Technologies Used:**
- Angular 18
- TypeScript
- RxJs
- HTML/CSS
- API integration

<!--
**Technologies Used:**
- Angular 15
- ASP.NET Core Web API 8.0 (Clean Architecture)
- TypeScript
- RxJS
- Angular Material

This project combines the Clean Architecture backend from the first project with a front-end built using Angular 15. The Angular application consumes the Web API and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

The key features of this project include:

- Angular 15 as the front-end framework
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- RxJS for reactive programming
- Angular Material for UI components
- Integration with the Clean Architecture Web API backend

This project showcases the integration of a modern front-end framework (Angular 15) with a well-structured backend, following the principles of Clean Architecture and CQRS.
