## Project 1: Clean Architecture with CQRS Design Pattern Implementation using Mediator

**Technologies Used:**
- ASP.NET Core Web API 8.0
- CQRS Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Entity Framework Core
- SQLite

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Clean Architecture pattern along with the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) design pattern using the Mediator pattern. The application is built using ASP.NET Core Web API 8.0 and follows the principles of separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

The key features of this project include:

- Separation of concerns between commands, queries, and handlers
- Use of the Mediator pattern to decouple the application logic from the infrastructure
- Integration with Entity Framework Core for data access
- SQLite as the underlying database

This project showcases the benefits of using the Clean Architecture and CQRS patterns, such as improved testability, scalability, and flexibility in the codebase.

## Project 2: Onion Architecture Implementation

This project showcases the implementation of the Onion Architecture pattern, a popular design approach that promotes separation of concerns and enhances the maintainability of the codebase.

The key highlights of this project include:

- **Layered Architecture**: The application is divided into distinct layers, such as Domain, Infrastructure, Application, API, and UI, each with a specific responsibility.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Higher-level modules depend on abstractions provided by lower-level modules, fostering flexibility and testability.
- **Data Access with Entity Framework 6**: The project integrates Entity Framework 6 for seamless data access, leveraging the power of SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition.
- **ASP.NET MVC 5 UI**: The client-side user interface is built using ASP.NET MVC 5, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience.

By following the Onion Architecture pattern, this project demonstrates the benefits of improved testability, flexibility, and scalability, making it a valuable reference for developers looking to implement a well-structured and maintainable application.

## Project 3: Angular 15 Front-end with Clean Architecture Backend

**Technologies Used:**
- Angular 15
- ASP.NET Core Web API 8.0 (Clean Architecture)
- TypeScript
- RxJS
- Angular Material

This project combines the Clean Architecture backend from the first project with a front-end built using Angular 15. The Angular application consumes the Web API and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

The key features of this project include:

- Angular 15 as the front-end framework
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- RxJS for reactive programming
- Angular Material for UI components
- Integration with the Clean Architecture Web API backend

This project showcases the integration of a modern front-end framework (Angular 15) with a well-structured backend, following the principles of Clean Architecture and CQRS.

## Project 4: ASP.NET Identity Implementation

**Technologies Used:**
- ASP.NET Core Web API 8.0
- ASP.NET Identity
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Entity Framework Core
- SQLite

This project demonstrates the implementation of user authentication and authorization using the ASP.NET Identity framework. It includes features such as user registration, login, and role-based access control.

The key features of this project include:

- Integration with ASP.NET Identity for user management
- Use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication
- Entity Framework Core for data access
- SQLite as the underlying database

This project showcases the integration of ASP.NET Identity with a Web API application, providing a secure and scalable authentication and authorization mechanism.
